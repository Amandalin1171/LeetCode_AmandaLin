/**
 * Problem 6
 * You are working in the HR department of a huge corporation.
 * Each employee may have several direct managers and/or several direct subordinates.
 * Of course, his subordinates may also have their own subordinates,
 * and his direct managers may have their own managers.
 * We say employee X is a boss of employee Y if there exists a sequence of employees A, B, â€¦, D,
 * such that X is the manager of A, A is the manager of B, and so on,
 * and D is the manager of Y (of course, if X is a direct manager of employee Y, X
 * will be a boss of employee Y).
 *
 * If X is a boss of Y, then Y can not be a boss of X.
 * According to the new company policy, the salary of an employee with no subordinates is 1.
 * If an employee has any subordinates, then his salary is equal to the sum of the salaries of
 * his direct subordinates.
 *
 * You will be given an array of pairs, where a pair (u,v) means u is direct manager of v.
 * Design an efficient algorithm to compute the total salaries of all the employees.
