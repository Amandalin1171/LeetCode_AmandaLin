/**
 * You are playing the following game. At the beginning of the game, you are given a sequence of n digitis (where n\ >1). And you need to divide this sequence into groups of digits, each group may consist of 2, 3, or 4 consecutive digits. For example, if you are given 123456, you can group it like (123)(456), or (12)(3456), etc. For each group you will get a score, where the score is the number of 1â€™s in its binary representation.
 *
 * In the example with input 123456, if you group the digits (123)(456), then
 * 	For the first group, binary representation of 123 is 1111011, so your score of this group is 6 since there are six 1s.
 * 	For the second group, binary representation of 456 is 111001000, so your score of this group is 4 since there are four 1s.
 *
 * You need to design an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum score you can get for the given input sequence
