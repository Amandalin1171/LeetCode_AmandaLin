/**
 * Some people think that the bigger an elephant is, the smarter it is.
 * To disprove this, you want to take the data on a collection of elephants and
 * put as large a subset of this data as possible into a sequence so that the weights are increasing,
 * but the IQâ€™s are decreasing. You have data for n elephants.
 * For each elephant i you know its weight w_i and IQ q_i.
 * Design an efficient algorithm to find such a subset of this data.
